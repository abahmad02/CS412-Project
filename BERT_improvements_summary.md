# BERT Model Improvements for IMDB Sentiment Analysis

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Extended Training Duration**
   - Increased `num_train_epochs` from 1 to 5
   - This allows more complete fine-tuning of the BERT base model

2. **Optimized Batch Processing**
   - Added `gradient_accumulation_steps=2`
   - Increased `per_device_eval_batch_size` to 16
   - Effective training batch size is now 16 (8 Ã— 2), improving training stability

3. **Learning Rate Optimization**
   - Set learning rate to `3e-5` (common optimal value for BERT fine-tuning)
   - Changed to `warmup_ratio=0.06` from fixed steps for better adaptation to dataset size
   - Implemented cosine learning rate schedule (`lr_scheduler_type="cosine"`)

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**
   - Added automatic detection of class imbalance
   - Implemented custom loss function with class weights when imbalance is detected
   - Created a `CustomTrainer` class that properly applies the weights

5. **Model Persistence**
   - Added code to save the best model and tokenizer
   - Created example inference code for applying the model to new text

6. **Enhanced Evaluation**
   - Added detailed classification report
   - Improved visualization of training metrics
   - Added token length analysis to understand truncation impact

## Expected Benefits

- **Higher Accuracy**: More training epochs and optimized parameters should lead to better model performance
- **Better Generalization**: Gradient accumulation and improved learning rate schedule help prevent overfitting
- **Fair Class Treatment**: Class weighting ensures the model doesn't ignore minority classes
- **Deeper Insights**: Enhanced visualizations help understand the training process
- **Practical Usage**: Saved model and inference example enable real-world application

## Using the Improved Model

After training, the model will be saved to `./results_bert/best_model`. You can load it using:

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizerFast

model_path = "./results_bert/best_model"
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(model_path)
```

See `bert_inference_example.py` for a complete example of using the model for inference on new text.
